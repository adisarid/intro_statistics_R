The likelihood function of a Bernoulli random variable is the probability of the results, i.e. a probability of a binomial random variable with $v$ success out of $n$ trials, with a probability $p$ for success:

$$L(p)=p^v(1-p)^{(n-v)}$$
Taking the $\log(L)$ we get:

$$\log(L(p)) = v\log(p) + (n-v)\log{(1-p)}$$
Then

$$\frac{d\log(L(p))}{dp}=\frac{v}{p}-\frac{n-v}{1-p}$$

Require that this derivative is 0 (to find the maximum):

$$\frac{v}{p} = \frac{n-v}{1-p}$$

If and only if:

$$v(1-p) = p(n-v)$$

If and only if:

$$np=v$$
Hence

$$\hat{p}=\frac{v}{n}$$
Using the second derivative (to make sure that this is indeed a **maximum** of the likelihood):

$$\frac{d\log(L(p))}{d^2p}=-\frac{v}{p^2}-\frac{n-v}{(1-p)^2} < 0$$
$$\square$$
