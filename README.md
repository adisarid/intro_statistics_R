# Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis with R

This is the repository for the course of **introduction to statistics and data analysis**, taught in Tel-Aviv university (0560.1823). The course is taught in the Engineering faculty in the "Digital Sciences for High Tech" track.

In this repository you will find all the required materials including lecture notes, references, class code, exercises, and more.

## Technical Information

In this course there are 3 lecture hours + 1 exercise (instructor) hour.

Lecturer: Dr. Adi Sarid.

   * Office hours: Please **coordinate in advance** via email.
   * E-mail: adi@sarid-ins.co.il.
   * Twitter: @SaridResearch
   * Mobile Phone: +972-50-8455450 (Please please try to reach out via email first).
   * Personal website: [adisarid.github.io](adisarid.github.io)

Instructor: Mr. Raphael Shuhendler.

   * Office hours: Please **coordinate in advance** via email.
   * E-mail: shuhendler@mail.tau.ac.il.

The course will be given in Hebrew, but all the supporting materials will be provided in English.

Garding will be based on: 

   * Final exam (60%)
   * Final project, individually (40%)

You will have homework but it's up to you to make sure you do them and understand them, we will not be grading them (only verifying that you submitted them).

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites for this course are:

   * Introduction to Probability (0560.2801 or equivalent). 
   * Mathematical Methods 1 (0560.2802 or equivalent).
   
This course is mainly designed for undergraduates with prior knowledge in probability and basic knowledge in math (a bit of Algebra and a bit of Infi), doing a BA/BSc with a "Digital Sciences for High-Tech" track. However, it would also fit graduate students which want to strengthen their knowledge in statistics and data analysis (or learn the very basics of R).

## Goals

This is a course in introduction to statistics and data analysis. The course covers fundemantal terms in statistics, such as significance, hypothesis testing, inference, sampling methods, variable types, modelling (regression).

During the course we will use the [R](https://www.r-project.org) language for demonstrations and exercises.

We will use publicly available "open data sets" (e.g., from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) and [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)) to demonstrate the various topics we will cover.

## Topics

   * Overview - from design to implementation: how a statistical research is conducted, from the design phases, through data collection and presentation.
   * Statistical inference and parameter estimation (e.g., average, standard deviation, percentiles).
   * Hypothesis testing:
      * Confidence intervals, unpaird tests, paird tests. Student's t-test, z test, a-parameteric tests.
	  * Goodness of fit (Chi-square, Kolmogorov-Smirnov).
   * The problem with p-value and significance testing in the age of big data. False discovery rate (FDR).
   * Analysis of Variance (One-way and Two-way ANOVA).
   * Planning experiments (multiple-comparisons), sample size calculations, power calculations.
   * Linear regression.
   * Correlation.
   * Logistic regression (if time permits).

## Software Prerequisites

You will need to install [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). RStudio is not mandatory to run R, but it provides a very environment for writing R code. Both software are available for free (for RStudio download the *RStudio Desktop Open Source License* version).

## Reading Materials

OpenIntro statistics is an introduction to statistics with R, it doesn't contain everything we will learn, but provides a good intro to some topics. Downloadable for free [here](https://leanpub.com/openintro-statistics/) (click on the "download sample" and the entire book downloads as a pdf file).

R4DS (R for Data Science) is a highly recommended book for learning R, and specifically *tidyverse* which is a collection of useful packages for data science. The book is mostly "technical", i.e., it does not provide much theoretical details. This book is also available in an online format [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
