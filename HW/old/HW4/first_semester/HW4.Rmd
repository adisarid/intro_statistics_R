This homework sheet is due on the 2019-12-30 You may submit your answers in pairs. Submit a PDF file with your handwritten solutions.
Submission will be performed electronically via Moodle.

We urge you to start solving this sheet as soon as possible and, if you have any questions, come to visit us in reception hours next week.

Across all the exercise. If not mentioned – use $\alpha$ = 0.05.


## Question 1

A biologist performed a regression on how much a planet diameter (x) affects it's mass (y), Based on 30 samples. His concllusion was $y ̂ = 10+0.1x$. were x is in trillions of tons ($10^{12}$ kilogram). Which regression line would he get if he would use units of ten trillions of ton? ($10^{13}$ kilogram)? \
Guidance - compute the new $ss_x,ss_{xy}$ as a function of the old ones. See what happens to new $b_1 = ss_{xy}/ss_x$ and $b_0 = \bar{y} -b_1\bar{x}$

## Question 2

Given that $\bar{x} = 432.2,\sum_{i=1}^{10}x_i^2 = 2,048,810,\sum_{i=1}^{10}y_i^2 = 103,195, \hat{y} = 5.821 + 0.195x$

Calculate:

  1. $\bar{y}$
  2. $R^2$
  3. is there a positive linear connection between x and y? Guidance, use hypothesis testing.


## Question 3

Based on the following samples: 

  1. find the parameters of a simple linear regression model ($y = a + bx$)
  2. Can we say that there is a linear relationship between x and y? Guidance, hypothesis test on the significance level of the regression.
